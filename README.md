# 👋 Hi, I’m Sundeep Maheshwaram

**MSc in Computer Science • Software Developer Intern @ CAT Technologies**  
I build web applications and data-driven prototypes using **ASP.NET / C#**, **Python**, and **MySQL**. I follow a *learn-by-building* approach — every new skill I pick up is accompanied by a small project or notebook that demonstrates it.

## 🔭 Current focus (actively learning & doing)
- **PyTorch & TensorFlow** — transfer learning for image & text models.  
- **MLOps / Deployment** — Docker, FastAPI/Flask, CI for ML, model serving & basic monitoring.  
- **Computer Vision Applied** — invoice & receipt OCR + structured extraction pipelines (NLP post-processing).  
- **System Design & DSA** — interview-ready algorithm practice + design basics for ML services.

> Each skill listed above is accompanied by a focused repo, notebook or demo <!--(links in Featured Projects)-->.

---

<!--## ✅ What I can show (proof I’m not just listing skills)
- Small, runnable projects and Colab notebooks.  
- A `/learning-log` with weekly commits (shows steady progress).  
- Pinned repos with clear README + inference script or Dockerfile.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [AI Invoice & Receipt Extractor](https://github.com/explorer-hello/ai-invoice-receipt-extractor)
**Description:** End-to-end AI pipeline for OCR-based invoice & receipt data extraction.  
Combines **Tesseract OCR**, **OpenCV**, and **NLP post-processing** to extract structured data  
(*Vendor, Date, Total, Line Items*) and export JSON/CSV outputs.  

**Highlights**
- Modular pipeline → `ocr.py`, `extract_entities.py`, `postprocess.py`  
- Colab notebook for easy testing & demo images included  
- Future scope: integrate FastAPI backend for API-based extraction  

**Proof of Learning**
> Built during my AI/ML self-learning phase to apply computer-vision and NLP together.  
> Demonstrates model training, inference, and data-formatting workflow.

### 🔹 [FastAPI Production Backend](https://github.com/explorer-hello/fastapi-production-backend)
**Description:** Full-stack **FastAPI** backend template designed for production-grade deployments.  
Includes authentication, environment configs, database layer, and modular routing.  

**Highlights**
- Scalable FastAPI architecture with SQLAlchemy  
- JWT-based authentication & role management  
- Dockerfile + docker-compose for containerized setup  
- Unit tests + logging + environment variables (.env)  

**Proof of Learning**
> Represents my transition from academic projects to building scalable backend systems.  
> I used this as a base for deploying ML APIs with real-world structure.
